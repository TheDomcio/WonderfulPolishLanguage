# Wonderful Polish Language 

## Preamble (Wstęp - Preambuła)

Hello, I am [Dominik](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik) 'Domcio' (The diminutive of the name  [Dominik](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik)) [Karol](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol) [[Wolfgang]](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang) (From the [Catholic Sacrament Of Confirmation](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bierzmowanie), so it probably doesn't really count, but it is still worth to mention this powerful name) [Rajchel](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polskie_nazwiska) and  I am currently 18 years old. I go to IT high school ([technikum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technikum_(Polish_education)) informatyczne). I have created for you this wonderful (I chose this adjective - "wonderful" as a reference to [Louis Armstrong's song "What A Wonderful World"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBrd_3VMC3c)) list - document of resources for learning - getting more experience with Polish language - I mainly dedicate it to foreigners who are looking for [re]sources to learn the Polish language, but also to my compatriots and aliens [and parrots] and not only for beginners or advanced people, this list is also useful for natives who are looking for new sources of education and entertainment in their language. I think this [**POWERFUL**] Polish is a really great language. Thanks to its flexibility you can create great compositions - poems etc. That's why I would like to really help promote it. Personally, I am constantly expanding the number of known words for me, because it is a very useful thing in my life [of creator]. I learn English from the first grade of elementary school ([Szkoła podstawowa](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szko%C5%82a_podstawowa)) and German from the first grade of middle school ([Gimnazjum](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimnazjum)), but I give less priority to German because it would only be useful for me to read [Grimms' Fairy Tales in the original language](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms_M%C3%A4rchen). At home, I learn mainly Japanese. In the future I am also going to learn other Slavic languages a bit more. The order of the links is mostly random. I add clean links, without any extra and referral code in URLs. Currently, I'm focusing on adding free and legal sources or those that also offer free legal content, so if something comes up here contrary to what I wrote a few words ago, report it to me, because I wouldn't do such a thing on purpose, but just by accident (it doesn't happen to me very often, I check the operation of the pages especially for you, I don't put links here blindly). Maybe in the future I'll also add categories with paid (also legal xD) services, but fortunately we live in such times that, thanks to the dedication of many people, we are able to learn from some awesome materials for 100% free. I hope that this version of my list is satisfactory. More than half a month has passed since its first publication and is now several times bigger. If you know any other good [free :D] websites related to Polish, feel free to let me know when a website has stopped distributing content fairly, please report it to me, also in case the website end its activity or changes the URL or project name or the page I added is now "really uncool". I can often joke about some things - speak about them in a very chill way, but please do not take anything personally, because I do not do this to offend someone, I just want to add variety - more colors to that content. Have fun with this Polish language adventure. Surely you can become a language champion - wield the most powerful weapons, that is the words. 

*Łubudubu, łubudubu, niech żyje nam ten projekt jednoosobowego klubu, niech żyje nam! To śpiewałem ja - Domcio.* 

Pozdrawiam was bardzo serdecznie i życzę miłej doby.

(I offered the [hamsters](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomiki) that destroyed the cables from the teleports to cooperate in searching for bugs in the text code. After that I repaired the teleport connections, so in this version all should work. By the way, this text file was, is and will be resistant to viruses, [here you can check scan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/467856e2d4fe0b14e4c625c372312c4edd425ba06e25fe12ea25217e190979e1/detection)).

By default, you can read only in the selected language, but there is a option to read that way: on one side you have the first selected language and on the next side you have the second selected language, so for example you can set fairy tale ["Cindrella"](https://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/aschenputtel) from [Hungary (Hamupipőke) to Polish (Kopciuszek)](https://www.grimmstories.com/language.php?grimm=021&l=hu&r=pl) or another example:  ["Rapunzel"](https://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/rapunzel) from [Japanese ( ラプンツェル) to Polish (Roszpunka)](https://www.grimmstories.com/language.php?grimm=012&l=ja&r=pl).

A lot of people will certainly be interested in [a book on forest recipes](https://www.lasy.gov.pl/pl/informacje/publikacje/e-book-od-lasow-panstwowych/dobre-z-lasu-czyli-natura-od-kuchni).

- [Wirtualne modelarstwo by Witold Jaworski](https://samoloty3d.pl/wm-000_p.xml) - Ebooks about aircraft computer modeling  (the programs that will be used are [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)).

This is a direct link to download the latest version (as of 22.09.2020). If you want to start your adventure with the world of programming and you don't know which language to choose for the start, I personally recommend [Python](https://www.python.org), because you can start this adventure in a very simple and quite relaxed way, but it is also worth trying to get to know other languages later, to have a kind of contrast and to be sure if this choice was fantastic, you can also know many programming languages and a lot of people do, but it is worth knowing one very well first, because then it is easier with others ([Here is the official tutorial page in Polish](https://www.learnpython.org/pl/)).

### Learning other languages or dialects etc. in Polish (Nauka innych języków lub dialektów itp. po polsku)

**(About learning other languages through Polish and also briefly about archiving websites)**

Hello world! I also thought that some of you will want to learn other languages through Polish or just my countrymen looking for cool sources may find something they missed earlier. Of course, I will try not to list here again the multilingual pages that are already lower on this list, because there is no need to make too many duplicates, but sometimes I can make an exception. Unfortunately, not for every language someone has published some sets of learning materials for free, so sometimes there may just be a lot of dictionaries here, I try to do research (on different search engines), but I often come across multilingual services, not focused mainly on a particular language or paid courses. I want share here a great amount of free and legal downloadable materials - for offline learning, because we live in the Internet times, but it is always worth having learning materials on disk to be able to look at them at any time - also many years later, and unfortunately, many websites are often run as hobby sites and may stop functioning with time, and there are for example [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) from [Archive.org](https://archive.org), but sometimes there are some larger files attached to the sites, which unfortunately are not always archived and are simply lost. By the way, [here you have a link to Github with links to download a excellent addon - "Save to the Wayback Machine"](https://github.com/VerifiedJoseph/Save-to-the-Wayback-Machine#download), which allows you to easily save pages to the web archive. If you would like to create a mirror of a website, then I also recommend a very simple [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) program or [WGET](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) for more advanced users. It is also possible to download from [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) using [this script - gem (Installation is really easy, just have Ruby installed and enter some commands in CMD according to the instructions)](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader) for [Ruby programming language (Ruby installer for Windows)](https://rubyinstaller.org/). So if you have ever created a website in the past, but you don't have its backup files, maybe some good person once made a backup copy of your website and you will be able to download it using this script and continue working on it because this script is downloading clean files, as if you were trying to download it directly through a copy from the archive, then e.g. such .html file will have a lot of additional links and redirections to the archive pages, not the original ones. 

Ah, maybe one of you has done or is doing something like my "Wonderful Polish Language" project, but in Polish and for another language, then I would be happy to add something like that here - below, if it would be in an fair form and consistent with my beliefs.

(Information - Informacja) 

Cześć! Jeżeli jesteś osobą, która nadal nie umie języka angielskiego na naprawdę komunikatywnym poziomie lub taką, zwyczajnie lubiącą szlifować swoje umiejętności lingwistyczne, to mam nadzieję, że poniższe linki będą dla was przydatne. Na edukację zawsze jest dobry czas i nie ma się czego wstydzić, a angielski jest kluczem do zdobywania wszelakiej wiedzy z różnych zakątków świata. Sam bardzo lubię się uczyć w języku ojczystym, gdyż jest to dla mnie oczywiście bardziej wydajne i przyjemne, ale języki łączą ludzi, więc warto znać ich, jak najwięcej, przynajmniej wszystkie, oprócz niektórych z nich. Angielski jest naprawdę wszędobylski, więc sprawia to, iż jego nauka jest znacznie prostsza, gdyż nie trzeba szukać go specjalnie, gdyż sam się zjawia w praktycznie każdej części życia. Warto również sprawdzić w tym celu resztę linków na tej liście, również serwisy wielojęzykowe, do których potężne łącza są dostępne [tutaj](https://github.com/TheDomcio/WonderfulPolishLanguage#multilingual-wieloj%C4%99zykowe). 

ENG: Welcome! If you are a person who still doesn't speak English at a really communicative level or one who simply likes to polish his or her linguistic skills, I hope the following links will be useful for you. There is always a good time for education and there is nothing to be ashamed of and English is the key to gaining all kinds of knowledge from all over the world. I like to learn in my mother tongue very much myself, because it's obviously more efficient and nice for me, but languages bring people together, so it's worth knowing as many of them as possible, at least all of them, except some of them. English is really ubiquitous, so it makes learning it much easier, because you don't have to look for it especially, as it appears in practically every part of life. It is also worth checking the rest of the links in this list, including multilingual services, to which powerful links are available [here](https://github.com/TheDomcio/WonderfulPolishLanguage#multilingual-wieloj%C4%99zykowe).

I add it as an interesting fact for people who know very well some language with Slavic roots. In short, it is simply a "Slavic [auxlang (international auxiliary language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language), which is something similar to Esperanto" (By the way, [Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof) is a Pole who created [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto)).

### Pingwin Mroźny

[Pingwin Mroźny (Penguin Frosty)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhssPbvaKk&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwAI-ulb6y8j-AfOiMKGLCN&index=2) - This is a character created by me ([Pingwin](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingwin_kr%C3%B3lewski) - first name and [Mroźny](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mro%C5%BAny) - surname). The mascot of my main channel and artistic activity. I created a whole [Universe](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wszech%C5%9Bwiat) around him. Each "typical" episode is intended to introduce the viewer to some kind of profession (the core of the Penguin's movements themselves refers to the video [Wonsz żeczny (humorous record of correct form "wąż rzeczny")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVPj0phGjyU), which is still present in Poland or was present in the old times - "extinct professions" and sometimes there were references to historical characters, I also invented some of my own professions. Here is [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HyAuXibszs), in which I described "how to get to know this universe so as not to get lost in it", i.e. I presented the chronology, because I created a lot of movies, as well as a [short] [computer game](https://gamejolt.com/games/pingwinmroznypoczatek/343963) and [also] a [short story](https://www.wattpad.com/594393714), so the viewer could get lost in my universe without it. A lot of people will ask "Why?", at that time my head was like a locomotive from which the steam flew all the time, so I wanted to find my way to "express myself artistically" and eventually I did it in this form, but I tried very hard, so these are not the kind of movies you would think if you look at them out of context. I also started to promote this kind of "pseudo-animation", which I personally called "dead animation". In other movies forms, a revolution began to take place, just like in Antic Theater - more [voice] actors (synthesizer voices) began to arrive. I am most pleased with the series ["Przygody Pingwinbada Żeglarza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to:  ["Przygody Sindbada Żeglarza" by Bolesław Leśmian]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_%C5%BBeglarza](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygody_Sindbada_Żeglarza)) and it's wordplay) ["Pingwinia Komedia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnP-kDL284&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqxtW04-v-yDyB7QUD__oAmn) (The name refers to: ["Boska Komedia"](https://wolnelektury.pl/katalog/lektura/boska-komedia/) - Polish translation of ["Divine Comedy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy) by Dante Alighieri). and from [the first episode of the "Danse Pingvinabre"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O15T5evhnQk) (The name refers to the medieval [Danse Macabre](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taniec_%C5%9Bmierci)) series. I wanted to include this long description (and I created a separate subcategory) in this list as "the main reward of my work", because I want to leave some remembrance and awareness in people to remember my works and also to open the door to potential cooperation and job. 

### YouTube

I like to add those channels that do not have exaggerate with the absurdity of thumbnails and titles - [clickbaits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait). I want to make it as easy as possible to retrieve information from the videos on this site without wasting your time on "one million [fillers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(media))" included in today's **typical** YouTube videos focused on massive marketing. Of course, it is not always possible to "escape" from this, so sometimes people who want to reach a larger audience want to adapt to the "standards of popularization of content" in this way. In the future I will add more categories and channels here, but first I want to focus on those already created, so as not to create categories with a small number of recommended channels. Forgive me for describing some great channels so short, because most of them deserve a few times more description. [Here you have quite a large list of some Polish YouTubers with profiles created for them with descriptions](https://apynews.pl/bio-youtuberow).

A very cool option if you want to learn between languages, your language will probably be on the channel.

Witam w mojej kuchni" and also from showing how to recreate a very well-known product at home, e.g. fries from a well-known fast food restaurant etc.  then it is worth to check out his older videos.

Recently, for example, she has shown how to cook some well-known dishes for cartoons and animated movies ([Ratatuille from Disney's Ratatuille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf0MkUYpV1k)).
- [Robert Makłowicz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCT_JGIn9I9FS6OTzzqWEew) - The official YouTube channel of the very famous Polish chef Robert Makłowicz, also known as ["Bezwzględny Gonzales"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zdWTljIa_4) (hehe).

For example, a guide to making [zakwas buraczany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rchyBgBaNG4) (very useful for people who, like me, do not drink alcohol, but are actors and would like to play a scene of drinking ancient wine).

- [The Food Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/Foodemperor) - This is a very interesting culinary channel, but beware, this cook very often speaks Polish vulgar language. Of course this is combined with dynamic music and tone - the expression of the chef's voice, so it gives a high style and of course it is also a comedy element. He also publishes versions of videos in Italian. This is a unique channel.
- [Czajnikowy.pl - dobra herbata!](https://www.youtube.com/CzajnikowyPl) - Very good channel about tea, but also about coffee created by experts.

#### Historical (Historyczne)

- [History Hiking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvPTDuK7LsXrzPUmi9AZzA) - The presenter in this program in a very reliable and professional way tells the viewers about various historical events in a very interesting and accessible way. The quality of materials is excellent and they are created with visible care. So it is really worth giving this channel a chance.

- [Historia bez cenzury](https://www.youtube.com/user/HistoriaBezCenzuryMB) - The historical channel, where the main anchorman - Wojciech Drewniak presents history in a cool, eccentric and humorous way. There is also an [English version](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd51P-3L-OiG-L4NH36ArAA/videos), but after three videos this project has been stopped.
- [Historia w 5 minut](https://www.youtube.com/Historiaw5minutpl) - The historical channel, which is called "History in 5 minutes", but videos don't always have the title five minutes, because the main purpose of the channel is to convey historical knowledge briefly, but without omitting important facts.

#### Cultural (Kulturalne)

- [Kocham czytać](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCJNpbx8LY8PM7jdnYfs7vg) - "I love to read," that is Jacek Kozłowski's YouTube channel, where he has been reading poems for over three years and also he reads a book entitled ["Pan Tadeusz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz_PCFd0DxY&list=PL_Q0c-Q5z7klqhGfQ40L140zY8eBKzZJs) and ["Anhelli"](https://wolnelektury.pl/katalog/lektura/slowacki-anhelli/) and also the [Bible - Gospel of Matthew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vmjw1fu714&list=PL_Q0c-Q5z7klCT_n9S2gWBKC8i0sdjKxV) from the New Testament - translation made by [Polish Jesuit Jakub Wujek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Wujek) - [The Wujek Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Wujek_Bible). 
- [mietczynski](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZP_DXnKgfs_ZX3RHVmu6qQ) - The person who recording videos for this YouTube channel is mainly known among Polish youth for humorous and simple summary of the various required school readings. He talks about them by adding more of his colorful metaphors and opinions, so he simply talks about the plot in an unconventional and accessible way, so it helps many people to remember the course of these books, which is often useful on all school "smaller" and "main" exams (I personally am neutral to this, but I add this channel objectively, because I know that many people like it for different reasons). He also reviews movies similarly and he also often tries to cook something - he verifies his culinary skills based on trying to cook dishes from popular recipes. 
- [Polimaty](https://www.youtube.com/Polimaty) - Very interesting channel about nice life topics (yes, it's worth to check it). It is also one of the best Polish podcasts. Actually, these are now "Polimaty 2.0", because the form of the program had a huge transformation some time ago and is not the same as at the beginning of the channel, it's worth to compare the current one with the previous one (both are cool in my opinion).
- [Krzysztof Gonciarz](https://www.youtube.com/KrzysztofGonciarz) - YouTube channel of the Polish traveler [Krzysztof Gonciarz](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Gonciarz), he lived in Japan for many years. He also worked as a journalist in the game industry ([GRY-OnLine](https://www.gry-online.pl/)] a long time ago and he wrote several books. He had many "metamorphoses of his public characters". - [At this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhbza5RsYK8) you can find sample video from [the TVGRYpl channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGnMWpCcoRZVWxkVKp3Ulg), in the creation of which, among other things, he participated. You may notice that also Marcin Łukański from a cool channel about movies, that is ["Na gałęzi"](https://www.youtube.com/user/NaGalezi) appears on this video.
- [MaturaToBzdura.TV](https://www.youtube.com/user/MaturaToBzduraTV) - Translating literally: "[Matura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura#In_Poland) is nonsense". The main concept of this YouTube program is to ask people (those who will agree to appear in the video, of course) about the things that are the "basics of basics" in Polish school education and simply such knowledge necessary for conscious life in our world - planet (for now, hehe, wait for us, Cosmos!). Often the questions are tricky and unfortunately people fall for them and it is possible that under the influence of stress their critical thinking temporarily decreases. An example of such a question is: "How is it said correctly: [Slovakia (Słowacja)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82owacja) or [Slovenia (Słowenia)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82owenia)?", and people hear more often about Slovakia (because [it is closer to Poland]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granice_Polski#D%C5%82ugo%C5%9B%C4%87_granic_Polski](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granice_Polski#Długość_granic_Polski)), among other things) and they wrongly think that since the question was asked, either of the two options is incorrect, obviously not everyone answers incorrectly. Another example is another such  question as clear as day: "'On whose side did the Americans fight in the [Battle of Grunwald?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald)" - this battle happened on July 15, 1410 (Poland vs [State of the Teutonic Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Teutonic_Order) and [we KO'ed them](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwa_pod_Grunwaldem#Przebieg_bitwy) - [here you can find all participants](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwa_pod_Grunwaldem#Uczestnicy_bitwy_pod_Grunwaldem)), [so it is [practically] impossible for Americans to take part in it in any way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas#Settlement), but it is precisely the people who too often think about two variants (terribly 0 or 1 thinking when both can still be right or none or another variant). Of course, here I don't make fun of these people, because as I say, among other things, the stress that they appear in front of the camera and probably their friends will watch this video makes their thoughts a bit confused in a lot of cases. [Here, you can watch, for example, a video about the knowledge of school readings by Poles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ENaBl3ybI).

#### Music (Muzyczne)

- [Live Act](https://www.youtube.com/user/heksmaestro) - One of the best Polish sources of knowledge about music production and theory. There are a few podcasts, which are a mine of knowledge for [not only new] music producers. Piotrek - the creator of the channel, he also touched upon psychological issues related to the creation of music, such as how to deal with creative blockades and [which DAW is "the best for start"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wtjCr-zp2g) (I personally recommend [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com) to start with or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) or [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/pl/download) and [LMMS](https://lmms.io/download)). So if you want to learn more about music (techniques, many cool tricks, world of producers and schemes and free plugins - VSTs etc.), then I really recommend it.

- [GOSIA SACAŁA TRENER GŁOSU](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwL-sRKiB4bEyFKbeL2KY3Q) - YouTube channel of voice trainer Gosia Sacała. In the videos she likes to evaluate in great detail the performances of various artists.
- [Studio Accantus](https://www.youtube.com/StudioAccantus) - A project associating brilliant vocalists, who together perform e.g. covers of great famous Polish songs, often from animated fairy tales. It is worth to watch - listen to those performances, because they are in really good quality. 
- [CeZik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktosL7nYkJlBnb2qAQ6liA) - Currently, unfortunately, already inactive CeZik's YouTube channel. He really created a lot of very creative music videos. In 2018, he released his album entitled "Ambiwalnięty" (This is [neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism): a combination of words: ["ambiwalentny"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambiwalentny) and ["walnięty"]([https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/walni%C4%99ty](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/walnięty)), [which you can listen to on his channel (this is of course the full version of the album)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqvsg8oRdrM&list=PLwhao0x8ZPbGEzKjva4v0EKWtJW_Zl223). It is really worthwhile to listen to the song entitled ["Jestem specem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pfk9v_Zs7U) which tells the story in music form that a lot of Poles usually think that "they know everything - they know every profession" (this is often true and a great plus for Poles that they want to know "about everything"). He also created the second, also in the past (and now often people return with nostalgia to the video from the old days) very popular YouTube channel ["KlejNuty"](https://www.youtube.com/KlejNuty), on which he "glued notes together" (the name of the channel is literally "GlueNotes" and sounds similar to the Polish word ["klejnoty"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/klejnot#pl) (jewels), it is often said that "something is a jewel", which means something brilliant - worth a lot, but not from this material side), i.e. he simply created songs (not exactly such remixes, only more songs, but it could also be called remixes nowadays) from words - discussion - statements of famous people. He is also known to have published on the aforementioned channel the video ["A Pole in the Britain’s Got Talent"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIM-w8ji9zQ), which is simply a adaptation - parody and the unoriginal soundtrack was combined - mixed with the original video track which made many people think that this video is entirely original and that this man was Pole (maybe he really was - some Polish roots, but the performance itself was in English). Recently he has been more involved in the ["NutkoSfera"](https://www.youtube.com/NutkoSfera) YouTube channel with lots of different songs for children.

#### Books (Książki)

- [Strefa Czytacza](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFUzlJ4yDspwLmqAK-HGxg) - Really cool YouTube channel about books and reviews of them. I found him a long time ago, but I haven't looked there for a long time, it's a pity, fortunately by creating this list, my memory on channel has returned. 
- [Book Reviews by Anita](https://www.youtube.com/bookreviewsbyanita) - Anita's channel, where she reviews books.
- [Doktor Book](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFX883oeu7KDGnGT0Yrn6cw) - Nikola's channel, who is passionate about reading books and also enjoys reviewing them.
- [Zaksiążkowane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP0LnBml_CVq5gaDD6qcsxw) - On this channel you can meet "Zaksiążkowane" who love to collect books and share updates of these collections. 
- [Bestselerki](https://www.youtube.com/Bestselerki) -  The channel of successive book lovers, that is Marta Gajewska and Anna Bartłomiejczyk. They actively run the title series "Bestsellers", in which video reviews of various books appear.

#### Social and philosophical (Społeczne i filozoficzne)

- [Wojna Idei](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7RswyY8VfbSdikz_8wdp3w) - A channel about psychological, philosophical, sociological and cultural issues - ideas. Author - Szymon talks in a very accessible way about various problems of today's world, as well as about the political system, etc. There is also an [English version](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw4PZWOXVE6ZjarvAUyugA). He also runs a second channel: [Szymon mówi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUrMqV57fp3uPddvmDpTaA), for example, he has long conversations with people with different political orientations, which is very interesting and rare, because it allows us to learn the views of different people, because often people close themselves in so-called ["filter bubble"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) and do not want to learn new information from "these other sites" - to give a chance to convince themselves of some things (I do not mainly mean political views - politics in general).
- [Nie wiem, ale się dowiem](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7KWO9E51KNtkDN_TfA69Q) - "I don't know, but I'll find out.", that YouTube channel also raises a lot of problems of today's world. This channel also has videos created in a very accessible form, so it helps with the main purpose - education - to make people understand certain things better. Projects such as this one and others deal with topics that sometimes do not have [mainly] a place or time in the Polish education system or are presented in a very "empty" way - too poor to be remembered and above all understood by [mainly young] students.
- [Człowiek Absurdalny](https://www.youtube.com/Cz%C5%82owiekAbsurdalny) - "important questions about life, philosophy, psychology, literature". Here, also, we can learn interesting things and again have reflections on various topics.
- [Klocuch](https://www.youtube.com/user/KlocuchRecenzje) - [Mr. Cuch's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS3xkUyqyUQ) YouTube channel. This is one of the legends of Polish YouTube, which shares its opinions on various topics in a very unconventional way, and you should not take things that he says personally, because all these words are said in a joke or some philosophical aspect (he often refers to things related to the childhood of many Poles). I also add it here because he speaks a very diverse language - he uses words from many dialects and loan words (a lot of German origin).

#### Comedy (Komediowe)

- [Zapytaj Beczkę](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBeeczka) - A [stricte](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/stricte) comedy [Krzysztof Gonciarz's](https://www.youtube.com/KrzysztofGonciarz) YouTube Channel. He laughs (in caricatured - cartoonish way) at various specific social phenomena and human behavior in his videos. 
- [Z Dvpy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhtAn1MT600xiNiX8ErnyQ) - Maciej Dąbrowski's YouTube Channel. He among others: creates quite specific videos about various cultural works, he reviews cities, he creates parodic dubbings and song covers and he also refers to recent events in Poland and in the world and he comments "the Polish YouTube scene". (there is a noticeable policy here and he sometimes likes to share his point of view, but does not do so in a very  intrusive way, I think that it is worth having your opinion own and have a calm mind - think clear-headedly).
- [Lekko Stronniczy](https://www.youtube.com/user/lekkostronniczy) - The YouTube channel, which is created by Włodek Markowicz and Karol Paciorek (The order of the names was taken from the YouTube channel description, as if someone would like to ask about it), they have been publishing videos (there's a new video every day) about current affairs since 2011 (there was a few year break, which ended over a year ago). They often talk about it in a humorous way, but they also know how to maintain the seriousness of the situation if it requires it. Karol Paciorek has his podcast channel which is called ["Imponderabilia"](https://www.youtube.com/ImponderabiliaTV), where he invites many very famous Polish people. Podcasts are known for the fact that some of them last really many hours and there are no unnecessary cuts (mainly in general, the assembly consists of changing the camera and colors). It is also worth adding in the subject of this channel that Karol had interviews with the candidates for the Polish President in Presidential Election [2020]. [Here you have a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKy6vIpzUstU33Qtra1v_dGSqP9RMXFwH) in which you can watch all the interviews with [almost all] candidates, including [the current and previous Polish President](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Duda). [Włodek Markowicz](https://www.youtube.com/user/wlodekmarkowicz) also has his own YouTube channel and is very famous for his movie ["Dots"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6UBkXLN4PI) (Polish, English, Spanish, Russian and German subtitles are available).

- [Pawelandbajer](https://www.youtube.com/user/Pawelandbajer) - YouTube channel, where its creator every day publishes a video with a kind of  joke called [in slang] ["suchar"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/suchar) (literally: [rusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusk)), but in the sense of a [positive] synonym for ["żart"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C5%BCart) and ["dowcip"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/dowcip) and ["kawał"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/kawa%C5%82).  So if you like this type of humor and you really like it when you have [like to listen simple] jokes in your life, then it is worth checking this channel.

#### Games (Gry)

- [TVGRYpl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGnMWpCcoRZVWxkVKp3Ulg) -The most popular Polish YouTube channel dedicated to computer games.

Some of their team also run a very interesting [Gospoda RPG channel](https://www.youtube.com/GospodaRPG), where they play ["classic Role-playing games (RPG)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game), i.e. those without electricity - using dices and those with [the game master (GM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_master).

With its latest movies it refers to the problems affecting today's [especially Polish] society. The main popularity of this YouTube channel has been brought by movies from the ["Wielkie Konflikty"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4f1Gyx2zhY&list=PLsuXZgkp0aLhss_09rp5y7stE-ai47los) series, as well as a parody of the song "Will You Be There" by Michael Jackson entitled ["Orki z Majorki"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZuFsI-bttM) (About [[oceanic] orcas (killer whale) ](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orka_oceaniczna) from Mallorca).

- [My playlist with "The best of Polish music creations"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCw3rMng0nw&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwxh63njdnt3emJ0rq0f2fp) - I have created a playlist of songs that are memorable, also a part of the Polish culture, often many jokes - references to them. I update it from time to time as soon as I have a "marathon of listening to music". So that's the playlist of "core songs of Poland" (But there's not much Disco Polo here anyway, I keep it to a minimum because it's still a subjective playlist, and I'm already bored with this genre and I think then that it's mostly "homogenous"). I'm also interested in Polish music from different times, so you'll find some older songs there, I'm also trying to add the best quality version to the playlist, and not thrown by a third party in very poor and even more compressed quality.
- [Lista przebojów TOP 30](https://kinopolskamuzyka.pl/top-30)  - TOP 30 of Polish music hits by Kino Polska Muzyka.

- [Katalog Biblioteki Polskiej](http://katalog.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/) - A catalog of polish songs.

There are usually several versions available in one archive file, i.e. versions with extra settings and the original version without any additional settings.

### Song lyrics (Teksty piosenek)

You will need it if you want to learn a language by listening to songs, because you will be able, for example, to listen and read at the same time or you can try to write down what you heard and then check the lyrics of the song to see if it is correct, it is certainly a nice method and quite mind friendly and not boring in my opinion. 
- [Groove](https://www.groove.pl) - Another option, there are a lot of song interpretations and, of course, the subtitles themselves, so this will come in handy if we want to understand the deeper meaning of the tracks. Sometimes you have to do some research anyway to find out what song had the true message, especially in case of old Polish songs, like those from the 80s. If you haven't found the meaning of a song, write to me, then I'll try to help you interpret it by helping you know the history of those times and knowing the people who lived then, because I'm from 2001, so hehehe, but I still have a lot of knowledge in that topic and I also got to know (my parents told me a lot about it) a part of the biographies of the local music artists, which can be useful in this regard.
- [Teksty](https://teksty.org) - service very similar to the above. It has a slightly more old-school look.

I, for example, used this forum to learn how to play ["Hejnał mariacki"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejna%C5%82_mariacki). I gave a link to the archive version of the forum, because it did not work for me personally, maybe some technical work is in progress. As far as the choice of instrument to play is concerned, I recommend the piano [keyboard] (king of instruments), but if you want something even simpler and very mobile, the harmonica and kazoo (a totally easy to play instrument) will also be cool.
- [Musicscore](https://musescore.com/) - A great collection of music sheets, in which you can also find Polish songs. You can also download [their official free and professional software to: "create, play and print sheet music"](https://musescore.org/pl)- I personally really recommend it.

## Tools and apps (Narzędzia i aplikacje)

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) - Powerful flashcards' tool. A great way to learn a language. It requires regularity, as is usually the case with learning something, but in a more simple and accessible way. The great inter-universal science committee found this to be one of the very good ideas.
- [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=pl) - [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) for Android.
- [AnkiMobile Flashcards](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) - [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) for iOS. 
- [subs2srs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subs2srs) - Great tool for creating flashcards from subtitles to your favorite movies and TV shows. Very useful.

If someone is curious, then the version on Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Mobile 10 still works, only this version on Windows 8.1 has fewer courses available, but still an interesting thing, but e.g. there is no Japanese course there, I personally use it to improve my English skill, it will always come in handy, especially many people can be surprised seeing the descriptions from this list, but calmly, I will improve it in the future and the future will come soon.
- [Quizlet (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizlet.quizletandroid&hl=pl) and [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quizlet/id546473125).

It is a nice Polish-English dictionary. Of course, [an iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/s%C5%82ownik-angielskiego-diki/id448207507](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/słownik-angielskiego-diki/id448207507)) is also available.

## Services (Serwisy)

- [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/languages/learn-polish-online) - Also a very nice service for learning Polish [in context]. Currently there is support to learning Polish via: English, French, German, Hungarian, Portuguese and Russian. The free version has a few limitations, but it's still okay and very useful, Pro version [among others] has more statistics, unlimited listening practice and downloadable content for mobile.

- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) - Practically everyone knows this wonderful service, which mascot is a green bird named Duo (just be careful and do regular lessons, then he doesn't get upset, it's very important, don't forget about your course, hehe). A Polish language course for English speakers is supported there (US, but people who know the UK version and others will understand as well). I have rewritten every English language course out of curiosity, but I mainly learn Japanese and Czech there (You can follow [my profile](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/TheDomcio), if you want to watch my progress on the platform, I recently returned to more active use of it). I used to be in the top league in the ranking, but now I've fallen by the lack of activity. Also, recently there was an option to learn Finnish, which I was interested in, and probably in 2020 there will be another available language to learn, this is a nice thing for people interested in other languages.
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/subject/polish) - something like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), but online and much more, so it's worth checking it out.
- [Quzizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/search/J%C4%99zyk%20polski) - A page with quizzes. There are a lot of quizzes created by teachers for their [mostly young] students, so it's a good option to repeat different things for example from the basics of grammar and so on.

## Culinary (Kulinaria)

- ["Kucharz doskonały"](https://polona.pl/collections/institutions/1/kucharz-doskonaly,NDI0ODQ1MDQ2MDQ4OTQ4NTQwMA/) - A wonderful collection of books, prints and manuscripts created by the Polish National Library. There are over 140 books by famous authors (in those days). They are mostly written in a language very similar to today's, and often also include words less commonly used today (but not archaisms), a lot of interesting recipes can be found there and of course you can download it all for free and probably without any major limits (maybe there is a limit, but with an attempt to download a huge amount). If you have a large amount of potatoes, it will probably be worthwhile to check the recipes from the book "200 potraw z ziemniaków" [(200 dishes from potatoes)](https://polona.pl/item/200-potraw-z-ziemniakow,MjAyNDY4NzU). Such a number of dishes should make you not be hungry for a long time.
- [Cookbooks (And more books) by Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa](https://polona.pl/search/?query=Lucyna_%C4%86wierczakiewiczowa&filters=public:1) - This author has written many cool books about cooking, on Polona you will find several of them in many editions. They are written in a pretty cool language. In the above link you will of course also find her works.
- [33 proven uses of chocolate in dishes](https://polona.pl/item/wedlowska-czekolada-33-przepisy-sprawdzone,ODQwODgyMjY) - If you like chocolate, this is something for you.
- [Jadłonomia ](https://www.jadlonomia.com)- A very cool website with "vegan recipes not only for vegans" (don't be afraid, I am a vegetarian myself, but I don't want to force convert you to vegetarianism, but often thanks to the dishes associated with this diet - vegan and vegetarian,  you can discover a lot of new taste sensations).
- [Olga Smile](https://www.olgasmile.com) - Very interesting culinary blog. Here you will find dishes from various diets, for carnivores, vegetarians, vegans and gluten-free for people with [coeliac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease) (Or for people who just don't like gluten).
- [Kulinarne Szaleństwa Margarytki](https://margarytka.blogspot.com/) - A very cool blog about cooking. Here you can find many interesting and unique recipes.
- [Moje Wypieki](https://www.mojewypieki.com) - "the sweetest recipe blog on the web". If you love sweet and beautiful looking cakes, then the recipes from this site can be very useful for you.
- [Whiteplate](http://whiteplate.com) - An interesting page where you can find a lot of recipes for baking rolls and bread. If you are a baker, it is worth to be inspired by such baked goods to make yourself better and better, because good bread is never bad.
- [IleWazy.pl](http://www.ilewazy.pl) -  A large base of products and their calorific value, fat, protein, etc. There is no need to be paranoid, but if you exercise, for example, it is worth knowing how much any food contains protein.
- [Czytamy Etykiety](https://czytamyetykiety.pl) - website with analysis of food labels. There are also food rankings, so if you live in Poland (and not only because there are a lot of products in Poland, which are also abroad, it sometimes happens that the composition is different, of course), and you try to eat valuable and relatively healthy food, it may come in handy. Of course, there are also descriptions of the ingredients from which food is made, e.g. [here is about high-fructose corn syrup](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrop_glukozowo-fruktozowy).

### Recipes for holidays and festivities (Przepisy na święta i uroczystości)

- These are the main ones, in some regions of Poland may appear additional. Very useful if you want to learn the names of the most important Polish holidays and festivities. Calendar for [2020](https://www.kalendarzswiat.pl/swieta/2020) and [2021](https://www.kalendarzswiat.pl/swieta/2021). [Polish holiday and  festivities names in English](https://www.ingless.pl/artykul/nazwy-swiat-w-jezyku-angielskim).

  - [Shrove Tuesday](https://www.przepisy.pl/przepisy/okazje/tlusty-czwartek) - It is definitely worth trying Polish pączki (filled with rose marmalade) and [faworki ](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faworki)[(chrust)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faworki), also [racuchy](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racuchy) I like to eat a lot of French fries this day (Because literally it means "Fat Thursday" in Poland). Often people bring [pączki](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pączek) to work and school and share them with others, in general, it is all about eating as much fat food as possible, it may be a slightly unhealthy holiday - "The largest cheat meal day in the year" xD. 

  - [Valentine's Day](https://www.mojegotowanie.pl/przepis/kruche-ciasteczka-walentynkowe) - (The same can happen in the days of a girl[friend] and a boy[friend]). On the occasion of that day, people give themselves handmade cakes, self-made cards or anonymous letters (in some schools, students go with such a box, where you can anonymously throw a letter to someone and then it is delivered to the addressee, it is such a way of secretly professing your feelings. At least it was possible in my early youth - a few years ago xD). I personally consider this holiday to be purely commercial ("holidays" of this kind can turn true feelings into a "product"), I think that if you really love someone, you can more often do such "private Valentine's Day", but I already think that doing something like that by yourself is more valuable than spending large sums of money on some mascots, which can also be a lovely gift, but would be even greater if there was an attempt to sew them yourself. This also increases the inner emptiness of loneliness of some people when they see an idealized image of couples buying each other's gifts, and some forget that they can also give gifts to their best friends or family on that day, because love is not only reserved for humans in very close relationships - in the end, it all comes down to spending time together, so just enjoy the moments with those you have at that moment, and don't regret the lack of moments with people you don't have at that moment (I know these are such [truistic](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pl/dictionary/english/truism) words and this is a heavy and complex subject).

  - [Easter](https://kuchnialidla.pl/przepisy/wielkanoc) - (In Poland it is not customary to invite ostriches for Easter, it is the ostriches themselves who have to ask for the invitation, vampires do the same). [This holiday is recognized as the most important Christian holiday (Not bad explanation)](https://www.sochaczew.pl/home/newsshow2/1383?title=Dlaczego-Wielkanoc-jest-wazniejsza-od-Bozego-Narodzenia). I like winter, but this holiday is more fun for me because I like eating armoracia rusticana (I look forward to the moment when I can try the true and fresh wasabi).It is also believed in some regions that at that time, ["Zajączek"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaj%C4%85c_wielkanocny) brings gifts, just like ["Święty Mikołaj"](https://123tlumacz.pl/swiety-mikolaj-czy-santa-claus-prawdziwa-historia) on the Christmas time ([Main Polish Easter Traditions](https://polskidlaobcokrajowcow.blogspot.com/2015/03/polskie-tradycje-wielkanocne.html) and [this is very useful also](https://ellalanguage.com/blog/wielkanoc-po-angielsku/)). This holiday may be a bit terrible for vegans, but here, too, it is mainly about symbolism - metaphors, so you can simply prepare alternative dishes and spend the time in the same way, because it is not really about food, which is often mentioned in this category. Religious (and not just them) people go to church in the morning with a basket ([about święconka](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Awi%C4%99conka)) of food to be consecrated by the priest. On the occasion of Easter in Poland, eggs are decorated to make ["pisanki"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisanka). (When it comes to such preparation of ornamental things, this holiday contains a lot of this, because seven days before Easter, that is, on [Palm Sunday](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niedziela_Palmowa), the so-called [Easter Palms](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_wielkanocna), there are often competitions for which palm is the largest).

    [Here](https://polona.pl/item/ciasta-wielkanocne,NzI1MzgwNDY) is a nice book about Easter cakes by Mrs. Elżbieta Kiewnarska.

  - [Christmas](https://www.przepisy.pl/przepisy/okazje/wigilia-i-swieta) - During [this period](https://eszkola.pl/jezyk-angielski/swieta-bozego-narodzenia-po-angielsku-4536.html), personally, I like to eat the [łazanki z makiem](https://www.zajadam.pl/boze-narodzenie/lazanki-z-makiem-i-bakaliami) very much. A lot of carols are also sung. It is a religious holiday, like most people, but it is worth being aware that it is a part of Polish culture and it is not only reserved for Catholics and [Christmas Eve](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigilia_Bożego_Narodzenia) can be attended by anyone. A lot of carols are also sung  ([Here you have an excellent list](https://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kol%C4%99dy/Wszystkie_pie%C5%9Bni_na_Bo%C5%BCe_Narodzenie)). It is a religious holiday, like most other holidays in Poland, but it is worth being aware that it is part of Polish culture and it is not only reserved for Catholics and [Christmas Eve](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigilia_Bożego_Narodzenia) can be attended by anyone, traditions are important for this country and the organizers are open to other nice people. It is mainly about family and friendly atmosphere, so you might as well spend time with your friends eating something good, not necessarily traditional food, but it would be great if you could. I will also mention that it is important to wait for [the [first] star in the sky](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigilia_Bo%C5%BCego_Narodzenia#Wigilia_Bo%C5%BCego_Narodzenia_w_Polsce) and many people go to a special night mass which is called [Pasterka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasterka).

  - [New Year's Eve](https://nietylkopasta.pl/przepisy-na-sylwestra) - During this period, you usually invite your friends home or you come to their house. You eat a lot of fast food/snacks, watch different movies together, play board games like [Eurobusiness](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobusiness), remember past years, plan things for the future. When the clock points 0:00, children drink non-alcoholic champagne (I also drink it because I like to be sober and not try to flood problems with alcohol) and adults often forget about their limits - It's often just divided into groups that older people with their friends, children with their friends, it's probably also common to spend the new year only with the whole family, but I think it's nice to spend this time with best friends too. 

(There is also a [pumpkin holiday](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) that is celebrated in the USA and some people want to celebrate in Poland, but it is really rated very 50/50 in Poland, some people think it's nothing bad - just fun, other Poles think that this holiday does not fit into our Polish - Slavic culture and has been forcibly brought from abroad for commercial purposes, I personally don't mind this holiday, but I also think that the latter opinion is really reasonable and it's just "some kind of event" and those who play it shouldn't require the Poles to take part in it too. The day after 31 is quite a sad day, that is [All Saints' Day](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uroczysto%C5%9B%C4%87_Wszystkich_%C5%9Awi%C4%99tych) for us such a Halloween once was an event called ["Dziady"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dziady_(zwyczaj)) ([Here you can read more about it](https://culture.pl/en/article/the-polish-halloween-all-you-need-to-know-about-dziady)).

This site can be very useful to you, for example if you once lived in Poland and attended a Polish school, and you've really liked a lot of people and forgotten their names, there's a chance that you'll find some pictures and details of these people there (These are also worth mentioning: [Gadu-Gadu](https://gadu-gadu.pl) or [Grono.net](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grono.net) - which lost its popularity when popularity of NK grew).

#### Reddit:

- [/r/learnpolish](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpolish) - Very nice subreddit about learning Polish. If you have any questions, doubts or interesting information about things related to the Polish language, feel free to write there. Poland is generally a nation willing to help others, there is a huge hospitality culture here since the beginning of the country, so for over 1000 years. In every society, there are stupid, silly and fanatic people, and Poland is no exception, so we should not generalize, because we have a lot of intelligent, nice and tolerant people here. Poland often lost out on such an attitude, because for other countries, as it be in Politics, only interests mattered.

##### Discord:

- [Learn Polish Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4U7Akj6) - The best Discord server to learn Polish. I would like to invite everyone here who has some problems with the language, is curious about something or just wants to talk to people in Polish, the community is open to other and active. I am too active here. 
- [The Language Sloth (Studying languages - Polish and #polski-chat)](https://discord.gg/languages)
- [Languages of Poland Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ADUAQNZ)
- [The Language Café (Slavic Channels category and #polish)]( https://discord.gg/AG4NMKJ)
- [Świta Domcia](https://discord.gg/aHthmme) - My own Discord Server which I created over 3 years ago. It is full of me because it is dedicated to my works. It's nicely developed, pretty quiet and comfortable. Friendly with descriptions for people from abroad. For example: there is a text channel with Penguins Frosty on the [📼odcinki📼](https://discord.gg/8Xqw7M) channel, also [📄napisy📄](https://discord.gg/XQbKuh) on which information about the subtitles added to the movies appears,  a text channel where my projects are described: [🌞moje-projekty🌞](https://discord.gg/MjGhFe) and also among other a text channel [📣za-darmo⁉](https://discord.gg/DNKCTn), where it informs about free games or [nice] programs etc. Which are available for free to claim for some time.
- [Przygody Reksia](https://discord.gg/aGRYDnP) - Discord server for fans of brilliant games from the "Reksio" series by Aidem Media (Yes, it's the same cartoon Reksio). The community is very friendly. You can also find here solutions to pass these games, but you will probably want to look at them to see how well you deduced the solution, not to see how to pass the whole game, right? The [Wiki](https://przygodyreksia.fandom.com/wiki/Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna) is also worth checking.
- [Nie wiem, ale się dowiem](https://discord.gg/3XhkCE) - The official Discord server of ["Nie wiem, ale się dowiem"](https://www.youtube.com/Niewiemalesiędowiem) YouTube channel, although it seems that recently main creator of the channel is no longer using this server very much.

## My nice tips (Moje świetne wskazówki)

- In Polish, there is such a thing that some sentences can be shortened. For example, instead of saying: "Jesteś mądry" [masculinum -y] or "Jesteś mądra" [in femininum **"a"** instead of **"y"**] (You are smart), you can tell: "Mądry**ś**"  or "Mądra**ś**" (Yes, -**ś** from jeste**ś**) or "Jesteś odważny" or "Jesteś odważna" (You are brave) = "Odważny**ś**" or "Odważna**ś**" or "Jesteś miły" or "Jesteś miła" (You are nice) = "Miły**ś**" or "Miła**ś**". If you want to become a knight or lady, it may come in handy to you, because it sounds a bit archaic, but I always remember that it's a cool thing, so I created this category to share such cool things with you.
- The word ["spoko"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/spoko) (comes from the word: "**spoko**jnie" - calmly) is a very useful and universal word. You can use it instead of "Nie ma za co" (You're welcome) and also "Nie ma problemu" (No problem), so when, for example, a neighbor apologizes to you that his piano fell out of his window into your garden, you can tell him: "Spoko". You can say that you like something, e.g. "Ten film jest spoko" ("This movie is cool"). It is from many years a very popular word, so even the older ones will understand. Of course, it can be used to, for example, soothe someone nervous - "Spoko, wszystko będzie w porządku" (Chill, everything will be fine). Or you can confirm something with this word e.g. someone asks you if you want to go to the cinema, then if you want to, you say "Spoko" ("Yes" in this case). So, if you are afraid to use the word "w porządku" and you still use ["**ok**ay/okey(/okej)"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/OK), then "spoko" can be a cool alternative for you. Of course, it's a slang word, so if you use it during a "serious conversation", someone might get the impression that you're a "relaxed kind of human", although that's good, because at least they will know you're an honest man.
- If you want to sound more like noble or just poetic (elevated/high style of speech), for example you can change the words (pronouns) "moim" (moje) to "mym" (me) and "twoim" (twoje) to "twym" (twe) [and more](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/Aneks:J%C4%99zyk_polski_-_zaimki#m%C3%B3j,_tw%C3%B3j,_sw%C3%B3j) (Also check [here](https://sjp.pwn.pl/poradnia/haslo/Me-twe-swe;18579.html) and [HIER](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowa_(retoryka)#Mowa_w_stylu_wysokim)). So if you're wearing daily a monocle and a cylinder, it's something **absolutely necessary** for you, don't forget also to take your own tea set [and also you should have a large stock of [[matricaria chamomilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_chamomilla) in your inventory] with a gilded cup (In general, this can sound a bit old-fashioned, but it's one of the cool ways to ["color"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/ubarwianie) your speech in Polish - sometimes one snowman from a certain cartoon talked in this style, so if you've watched this cartoon about a helpful green dragon, you'll know who was it).
- If you want to call (define) a person who likes something with a simple noun, you can do so by adding the ending (yes, yes - sufiks) **-olub** (or -**olubka** in femininum). For example a person who likes pasta = makaron**olub** or, for example, a person who likes locomotives = lokomotyw**olub** and yet a person who likes images = "obraz**olub**". It is a bit "synthetic" and may sound funny, so use it rather for such "chill conversations", then implement it in your everyday language, because, there are already [more "professional"] dictionary terms for people who like something like "audio**fil**" (audio**phile**) and its synonym: melo**man** (music lover and the suffix **-man** itself, that is from the word ["mania"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mania), so it means a person who has a [mania](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/mania) at some point, so a person who's maniacally eating broccoli ([brokuł - Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broku%C5%82](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokuł))) is "brokuło**man**" or "brokuło**maniak**" with [**-maniak**](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/maniak)). I would just add that you can also do the same with the ending [**-fil**](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/-fil), but there are also a lot of words to describe people with very bad tendencies (with various disorders) and you know what I mean. That is why the creation of words with this ending would be badly associated with some bad things. By the way, I would also like to take this opportunity to say that if, for example, we would like to define a human-like creatures, then we can do it by adding the ending **-lud**, e.g. a frog ([żaba](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBaba_wodna)) with legs and hands and behaving like a human - żabo**lud** or also you can use the ending **-człek**, then żabo**człek** or another example of "human + elephant ([słoń](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82oniowate))" - słonio**lud**/słonio**człek** (There is a very popular word in Polish - "ufolud" and the diminutive of this word - ["ufo**ludek**"](https://sjp.pwn.pl/slowniki/ufoludek.html) and it means "alien"). I will add, finally, that if we want to define a person who eats (she or he or it has a lot of this food in diet) something, for example watermelons ([arbuzy - Citrullus vulgaris](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbuz_zwyczajny)), then we can add the ending **-jad** and then such a person will be called arubozo**jad** or with sufiks **-żerca**, then "arbuzo**żerca**" or jabłko**jad**/jabłko**żerca** (apple-eating creature). Creatures with a plant-based diet = roślino**żercy** and those with a diet in which there is meat = mięso**żercy**, then for example, "dinozaury roślino**żerne**" (herbivorous dinosaurs) and dinozaury mięso**żerne** (carnivorous dinosaurs). So you can say in joke that vegetarians and vegans are: "roślino**żerni**/roślino**żercami**". 
- I mentioned to you earlier the use of the word ["spoko"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/spoko). I will now tell you about another very useful and universal word (it comes from colloquial speech), the word ["lipa"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/lipa) (Literally means ["lipa"](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipa) - [Tilia - Linden or Lime tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilia)). It is a word that means something not entirely cool or just a failure to do something etc. For example, someone may ask: "Byłeś już w tej kręgielni, która została niedawno otwarta?" (Have you been to this bowling alley that was recently opened?) and someone can answer: "Tak, totalna lipa" (Yes, totally uncool). So, as you can see, this is the complete opposite of the [positive] word ["spoko"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/spoko). Another example: "Czy udało ci się przejść ten poziom w tej nowej grze?" (Have you managed to pass this level in this new game?) and answer: "Nie, nadal lipa" (No, still not successful). You can also use this as a "statement - shout of sad" - "Co za lipa!" (Such a shame!) or alternative "Ale lipa!" (For example, when you lack a small amount of money to buy something or when just a small moment before you arrived at the bus stop, the bus you wanted to go with, drove off right before your eyes and now you have to wait 30 minutes for another one). One more example to conclude: "Jak smakuje ci ten dziwny owoc?" (How does this strange fruit taste to you?) and answer: "Lipnie" (Poorly - It's an adverb of this specific use ["lipa"](https://pl.wiktionary.org/wiki/lipa), normally, it would be correct to say "lipowe", for example "lipowa herbata" - linden tea). If you want to use this example in the plural, it would be, for example "Lipne jedzenie" (Poor food). That is the next word kind of: everyone, regardless of their age, will understand the word, because it is quite often used by people from different parts of the country (Wooden people will probably never use it in their entire lives, although Pinocchio would be happy to use it, but it is not about him).

## Others (Inne)

- [6obcy](https://6obcy.org)  - Website for talking to strangers from different regions of Poland and abroad. You can meet many interesting people here, but you can also find a lot of "suspicious people", so be careful. (M - mężczyzna - male, K - kobieta - female, so at the beginning of the conversation, when someone writes "K", it means that she says she is a woman, it's a pattern that often occurs, or e.g. M20 = a man who is 20 years old, for some people it's just something like a dating chat).
- [Nonsensopedia](https://nonsa.pl/wiki/Strona_g%C5%82%C3%B3wna) - A parody of Wikipedia in Polish and as the name itself says, it is full of nonsense (The equivalent of English [Uncyclopedia](https://simple.uncyc.org/wiki/Main_Page)). Sometimes you can find hilarious articles (So stupid |applause for the creativity of their authors| then it could make you laugh) here, especially in those areas that we are very interested in and familiar with. There is certainly a lot of 'difficult humor' here, so it is rather for people with a specific sense of humor.

## My others projects (Moje inne projekty)

- [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/Domcio) - On which channel I mainly focus on making movies with [Pingwin Mroźny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhssPbvaKk&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwAI-ulb6y8j-AfOiMKGLCN). Nowadays, due to technical problems - weak hardware, which often has problems with video rendering (it just really takes away my motivation, I will have to go back to some older film editing software or some other free alternative), I rarely upload movies, there was a year when practically every day a video appeared, so it is a huge decrease in activity.
- [My Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/DominikRajchel) - On which I write from time to time some poems on various topics, you can also find here my short story ["Pingwin Mroźny: Preludium"](https://www.wattpad.com/594393714) and ["Baśnie dla każdego stworzenia i nie tylko" (Fairy tales for every creature and not only)](https://www.wattpad.com/648685825-ba%C5%9Bnie-dla-ka%C5%BCdego-stworzenia-i-nie-tylko-s%C5%82%C3%B3w) which is a collection of my various fairy tales, there are not many of them there yet, but I already have a lot of ideas for more in my notes, so it is only a matter of finding time and writing it.

- The best PC software list (Or something like this) - Coming soon. This will be a great software list, for example: The best music player for Windows: [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) etc.
- My text-based computer game that I am writing, while learning another programming language, will probably want to publish it as a GitHub repository, but I don't know if I have enough time to continue this programming adventure with this particular language - Python. I'm already learning several languages at school, and soon - at the end of the school semester - I'll have the last two exams (before the final high school graduation exam), so when I'm done with them, I'll probably come back to this topic, I'd also like to learn how to create music (I'm planning to take some piano lessons in the future, when I have some money, because I could use this ability to create melodies from nothing). I would also like to write some poems etc. and make more movies with [Pingwin Mroźny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdhssPbvaKk&list=PL2yH5_nRkFqwAI-ulb6y8j-AfOiMKGLCN), so the queue of what I want to do is colossal and I often change these "creative sides of life" ((from video to writing, from writing to music, from music to programming and this loop is repeated infinity times ∞) when it comes to working on something.


## Lorem ipsum

Lorem ipsum. To jest taka ciekawostka. Nie chciałem, żeby w dniu publikacji ostatnią kategorią była [„pechowa trzynasta kategoria”](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekafobia), więc dodałem tę - wtedy jako czternastą. Oczywiście to takie nawiązanie do [m.in.] polskich [zabobonów]([https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przes%C4%85d](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przesąd)), może też i jakiś czarny kot się tutaj kiedyś pojawi.
